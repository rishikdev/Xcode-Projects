                <p>Xiaomi may soon be following Motorola in putting a 200-megapixel camera in an upcoming smart phone, as it seems that the former is working in the tech too. Reports claim that there is another phone that will launch with a 200-megapixel sensor. Said phone will also feature a 120Hz display, 5,000 mAh battery, and a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset.</p> <p>While the leak didn&#8217;t name the brand, some speculate that it is a Xiaomi phone. More specifically, the Redmi K50S Pro or the Xiaomi 12T Pro. Both may end up being the same phone, just different names for different regions.</p> <p></p> <p>The sensor is going to be from Samsung, either their ISOCELL HP1 or ISOCELL HP3. Both are 200 megapixels, with the difference being the pixel size and optical format &#8211; 1/1.22” and 0.64µm and 1/1.4” and 0.56µm, respectively (before 4-in-1 binning).</p> <p>Motorola is using the larger HP1 sensor, recently posting a camera sample of it. The sample shows what the sensor can do with its 4-in-1 pixel binning enabled, which is still a 50-megapixel picture.</p> <p>It&#8217;s not quite clear which sensor Xiaomi will go for. However, given the flagship spec 8+ Gen 1 chipset, The HP1 makes more sense.</p> <p id="caption-attachment-197618" class="wp-caption-text">Xiaomi 12S Ultra</p> <p>Xiaomi&#8217;s latest flagship, the recently launched 12S Ultra, currently features a 50-megapixel main camera. Compared to this, the HP1 sensor sounds better on paper. It will be interesting to see how the sensor will perform in real world testing. The Xiaomi 12S Ultra features an ultra-wide and telephoto lens, which are both 48-megapixel. The telephoto camera has a periscope lens, giving it up to 120x zoom capabilities. Furthermore, will the current partnership between Xiaomi and Leica continue for the upcoming device? We will have to wait and watch to find out.</p> <p>A 200-megapixel ultra premium smartphone sounds quite exciting. But, as smartphone prices creep further upwards, how many people will actually buy one? A 200-megapixel flagship is not going to be cheap. Let us know your thoughts below.</p>

                <p>Asus has finally announced the launch date of its flagship, the Zenfone 9. The company announced that the smartphone will be released in global markets on July 28. The launch event will take place in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, and will be live-streamed as well. Globally, the smartphone will be launched as the Zenfone 9, but in India, it will be known as the 9z.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"></p> <p>Asus has teased that the Zenfone 9 will be &#8220;Compact Size&#8221;, hinting at its size. Last year&#8217;s Zenfone 8 was a delight, compact and one-hand usable, like the android equivalent to the iPhone 13 mini. Unlike last year, Asus may not launch two phones, with the Zenfone 9 launching only as reports suggest.</p> Asus Zenfone 9: Specifications <p>Specifications of the Asus Zenfone 9 are yet to be confirmed. However, a leaked video from last week revealed a number of features and specs. Powering the Zenfone 9 will be Qualcomm&#8217;s Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processor. The display is a 5.9-inch AMOLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate while the battery is a 4300 mAh unit with 65W fast charging support. </p> <p class="wp-caption-text">Video Via GSMArena</p> <p>The two biggest talking points from the leak are the cameras and Zentouch. The Asus Zenfone 9 will use Sony&#8217;s 50-megapixel IMX766 sensor as the main shooter. Though the sensor is used by a lot of other smartphones, its Asus&#8217; integration of a 6-axis hybrid gimbal stabilizer that makes it unique. Gimbals are mainly used to give increased stability to cameras. It will be interesting to see how it performs in the Zenfone 9.</p> <p>The other big feature is what Asus has dubbed the Zentouch. It allows the power button (itself dubbed the Smart Key) to essentially work as a scroll wheel to slide up and down webpages. It has been ages since scroll wheels on phones went extinct, and this could be the best way to make a comeback. The power button also works as a fingerprint sensor. </p> <p>Other features include a 3.5mm jack (always welcome), dual speakers, and an IP68 water resistance rating.</p> Asus Zenfone 9: Price <p></p> <p>Though prices for the Asus Zenfone 9 haven&#8217;t been revealed yet, a tipster suggested the Zenfone 9 could cost between EUR 800 (INR 64,700) and EUR 900 (INR 72,800. The leaked video also showed off the colour choices for the Zenfone 9, red, white, blue, and black. What do you think of the Zenfone 9? Would you be interested in buying it?

                    <p>Motorola didn&#8217;t launch a new Razr in 2021, with reports and leaked details strongly suggesting a new model to be launching this year. Yesterday, the upcoming Motorola Razr (codename Maven) was officially showcased in China. Though it was more of a sneak peek than a full reveal, the pictures give us a glimpse at the foldable&#8217;s design.</p> <p>Chen Jin, Lenovo Mobile Chia GM showcased the next Motorola Razr at a press event. The handful of pictures taken shows the device in both folded and unfolded form. As seen in the images, the new Razr ditches the &#8220;chin&#8221; design of the earlier models that emulated the original 2000s Razr.</p> <p></p> <p>Pictures of the new Razr, when closed, give us a look at the new dual-cameras at the bottom right corner. The new Razr design actually looks quite similar to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"></p> <p>A teaser video posted on Weibo further shows off the new Motorola Razr. The new hinge looks inspired by Samsung&#8217;s design, as well as the new larger outer display, the main USP of the Galaxy Z Flip.</p> https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Motorazr.mp4 <p>Previous leaks have already confirmed that the new Motorola Razr will be powered by a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 chipset. The latest spec leaks suggest that the new Razr will feature a 6.7-inch P-OLED folding screen, 120 Hz refresh rate, and a redesigned hinge. The outer display is expected to be bigger than before at 3-inches. Camera duties will be handled by a 50-megapixel main camera and a 13-megapixel ultra-wide.</p>

                    <p>Nothing Tech is the latest venture from Carl Pei, Ex co-founder of OnePlus. Nothing&#8217;s first product was the Nothing Ear (1), a pair of TWS earbuds with a transparent design. And now, after months of slow reveals and teasers, Nothing has finally launched its first phone. Aptly named the Nothing Phone (1), the phone has been one of the most anticipated launches in recent memory. We at iGyaan take a look at the latest smartphone in the market.</p> Nothing Phone 1 Design <p>Nothing founder Carl Pei had promised that its first smartphone will stand apart from its competitors, and it is safe to say they have succeeded. The Nothing Phone (1) comes with a bezel-less display, giving it a uniform width across the screen. The frame is made from completely recycled aluminium.</p> <p></p> <p>However, the most striking and talked about aspect of the device is the back, which features a transparent design. The phone &#8220;shows off&#8221; its internals, something that no other manufacturer has done with their products yet. The back of the Nothing Phone (1) also features a number of LED lights, dubbed the Glyph Interface. The LEDs have unique light patterns depending upon the scenario, for example, the LED lights on the bottom of the phone acts as a charging indicator. There are also preset ringtones that uses the Glyph Interface which lights up the LEDs in a set pattern in sync with the ringtone. Furthermore, users can add their own sounds, which the LEDs automatically sync to.</p> <p></p> Nothing Phone 1 Specifications <p>The Nothing Phone (1) is powered by Qualcomm&#8217;s Snapdragon 778G+ chipset while the Adreno 642L handles GPU duties. The device will be launching in three variants, either with 8GB ram and 128 GB internal storage space, 8GB and 256 or with 12 GB and 256 GB. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s no expandable storage. On the software side, the device features Android 12 out of the box, with the company&#8217;s own Nothing OS 1 UI skin making its debut. Nothing is providing 3 years of OS updates, and a further year of security patches.</p> <p></p> <p>The display of the Nothing Phone (1) is a 6.5 inch, 2400 x 1080 flexible OLED unit. The screen features an adaptive refresh rate of 120 Hz and supports HDR10+. Due to the phone&#8217;s flexible OLED panel, the screen bends round the sides, giving the screen a uniform width across all corners. The display is a flat unit, unlike some of its competitors. Also unlike some of its rivals, the Nothing Phone (1) comes with a dual-rear camera setup. Both the main shooter (f/1.8) and the ultra-wide(f/2.2) are 50 megapixels. The rear cameras can record videos at 4K/30Fps and features OIS. The Glyph LED lights also act as a fill flash, there is a standard flash LED apart from the Glyph. The front camera is a 16-megapixel unit that can also record videos at 1080p/30fps.</p> <p></p> Pricing And Availability <p>Sales for The Nothing Phone (1) will start at 7 PM IST on 21st July 2022, exclusively on Flipkart in India.

The front camera is a 16-megapixel unit that can also record videos at 1080p/30fps.</p> <p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-197477 aligncenter" src="https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Nothing-Phone-1-iGyaan-13-1100x618.jpg" alt="" width="1100" height="618" srcset="https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Nothing-Phone-1-iGyaan-13-1100x618.jpg 1100w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Nothing-Phone-1-iGyaan-13-320x180.jpg 320w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Nothing-Phone-1-iGyaan-13-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Nothing-Phone-1-iGyaan-13-768x431.jpg 768w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Nothing-Phone-1-iGyaan-13-1536x863.jpg 1536w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Nothing-Phone-1-iGyaan-13-20x11.jpg 20w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Nothing-Phone-1-iGyaan-13-40x22.jpg 40w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Nothing-Phone-1-iGyaan-13-80x45.jpg 80w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Nothing-Phone-1-iGyaan-13-1000x562.jpg 1000w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Nothing-Phone-1-iGyaan-13-1200x674.jpg 1200w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Nothing-Phone-1-iGyaan-13.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px" /></p> <h2>Pricing And Availability</h2> <p>Sales for The Nothing Phone (1) will start at 7 PM IST on 21st July 2022, exclusively on Flipkart in India.

                        <p>Samsung launched the Galaxy S21 series on 14th of January 2021.

There are discounts however, during preorder a Rs. 6000 instant discount and Rs. 10000 discount using HDFC cards. </p> <p></p> <p></p> Unboxing Experience  <p>The box of the Galaxy S21 Ultra resembles the iPhone 12 series boxes.

This gives the device a 515 ppi pixel density.  The display also has a peak brightness of 1500 nits and is protected by the same Victus glass that is seen on the back of the phone.

And even though India still gets the Exynos based devices. The Exynos 2100 is pretty well matched with the Snapdragon 888 chipset. Both are built on the 5 NM process and offer up an octave core CPU experience. However Samsung&#8217;s Exynos 2100 is clocked much higher with a 2.9 GHz top clock.  The GPU lacks behind on the Samsung chip, but they are well matched for AI computation capabilities and ISP performance with the 888&#8242; spectra 580 providing computational HDR video capabilities which the Galaxy S21 Ultra misses out on. </p> <p><a href="https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-iGyaan-11.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-197208" src="https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-iGyaan-11-1100x619.jpg" alt="" width="1100" height="619" srcset="https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-iGyaan-11-1100x619.jpg 1100w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-iGyaan-11-320x180.jpg 320w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-iGyaan-11-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-iGyaan-11-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-iGyaan-11-1536x865.jpg 1536w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-iGyaan-11-20x11.jpg 20w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-iGyaan-11-40x23.jpg 40w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-iGyaan-11-80x45.jpg 80w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-iGyaan-11-1000x563.jpg 1000w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-iGyaan-11-1200x676.jpg 1200w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-iGyaan-11.jpg 2000w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px" /></a></p> <p>Benchmarks are up there and performance from the device for the couple of days we have tested is irrefutably smooth. However, the Exnos 2100 when pushed seems to be getting the top back corner of the Galaxy 21 Ultra uncomfortably hot. We are using a pre release device with pre release software. So the clocks may be adjusted for the final release. </p> <h3>Battery and Connectivity</h3> <p>The 5000mAh battery does justice to the phone. Samsung continues to include 25W charging as that seems to be sweet spot for battery charging speeds. No charger is included however, Samsung will happily sell you one for Rs. 2000. </p> <p>The phone supports USB PD3 and wireless charging upto 15W. You can also reverse charge in case of emergencies for upto 4.5W.</p> <p><a href="https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-iGyaan-06.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-197204" src="https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-iGyaan-06-1100x619.jpg" alt="" width="1100" height="619" srcset="https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-iGyaan-06-1100x619.jpg 1100w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-iGyaan-06-320x180.jpg 320w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-iGyaan-06-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-iGyaan-06-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-iGyaan-06-1536x865.jpg 1536w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-iGyaan-06-20x11.jpg 20w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-iGyaan-06-40x23.jpg 40w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-iGyaan-06-80x45.jpg 80w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-iGyaan-06-1000x563.jpg 1000w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-iGyaan-06-1200x676.jpg 1200w, https://www.igyaan.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Galaxy-S21-Ultra-iGyaan-06.jpg 2000w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px" /></a></p> <p>The Samsung Galaxy S21 Series is 5G capable whether you get the Snapdragon 888 or the Exynos 2100 variant. Both have Sub 6 and mmWave 5G bands. However, India is yet to fully roll out 5G for the next year or so and by that time S22 series will be out. </p> <p>The phone has 2 sim slots and no microSD expansion. Bluetooth 5.2 along with A-GPS, GLONASS, BDS, GALILEO for location mapping.  The fingerprint sensor is located under the display and is an ultrasonic sensor which makes for super quick unlocks. </p> <p>If you are a business user the Galaxy S21 Ultra also offers Samsung DeXand Samsung Wireless DeX for on the go productivity. </p> <p>Samsung seems to have ticked all the right boxes, however our testing has just begun and if first impressions are something to go by, The Galaxy S21 Ultra will be tough competitor for upcoming phones of 2021. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p>

The chiclet style keyboard features a scissor mechanism with an ABS texture. Each key has a 1.3mm of key travel and able spring making it comfortable to type. </p> <p>The base variant of the Mi Notebook 14 features a 10th generation core i5-10210U CPU which has a 1.6GHz quad-core setup with a boost clock up to 4.2GHz. this is paired with 8GB 2666MHz DDR4 RAM and 256GB of SATA 3 SSD storage. The second variant bumps the storage to 512GB of SATA 3 SSD.</p> <p>The Horizon Edition  two options for the CPU, the same Core i5-10210U  and a Core i7-10510U CPU with a 1.8GHz quad-core setup and a boost clock up to 4.9GHz. You still get 8GB 2666MHz DDR4 RAM, however, the storage has an optional m.2 NVME PCI Express Gen 3 SSD upgrade with 512GB of space. This has a rated 3000 MB/s sequential read and a 1800 MB/s sequential write speed. Drastically boosting I/O and Read Write operations. </p> <p>The Horizon edition with the i7 also adds a USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type C port, along with the standard ports which include 2 Type-A USB 3.1 Gen 1 and a single USB 2.0, 1 HDMI port a Combo Audio Jack and the Charging Port.</p> <p>The Mi Notebook 14 Horizon edition also has a GeForce MX350 2GB GDDR5 VRAM equipped DGPU.

The 10 bit display is also HDR 10+ rated and the phone utilizes the edge in several ways.  The most interesting of which is the ability to add trigger buttons to the edge of the screen. These will act as tactile buttons during gaming on games like PubG Mobile and COD Mobile. The display is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5. </p> <p>The edge also is used to navigate through the UI. can be used to pull down the notification shade, pull up the apps, jump into multi tasking and also access shortcuts.</p> <p>The Edge has lighting effects which also appear during charging or can be customised for notifications. </p> <p></p> Hardware  <p>The Motorola Edge+ features a impressive mig of hardware under the hood. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 ties in the main compute with the Adreno 650 GPU for graphics. This is packed with 12 GB RAM and 256 GB of storage. this combination puts serious hurt on smartphones like the Galaxy S20+ which feature exynos chipsets and lower RAM and storage. </p> <p>The Moto Edge+ also ties in a massive 5000 mAh battery although charging is limited to 18W.

This is one of the best uses of the camera space much better than the 2 MP or 4 MP macro sensors seen on other devices. The third camera is an 8MP telephoto camera. The cameras are paired up with a TOF sensor to improve depth mapping. </p> <p>The front camera has a 25 MP, f/2.0 sensor which is capable of portrait shots and slow motion video. </p> <p></p> Other Aspects <p>The Motorola Edge+ is a return to flagship device for Motorola.

                                        <p>Apple has updated their 2019 lineup of the iPhone with the iPhone 11. This is more a revision to the iPhone XR which retains the design and aesthetic.</p> <p>The design however uses a new square block on the back to house the new dual cameras. The dual camera allows portrait mode for humans and non human shots which was not possible on the iPhone XR. The cameras also shoot 4k 60p across both cameras. The difference here is that one of the cameras is an Ultra wide instead of telephoto. </p> <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4p6njjPV_o</p> <p>The iPhone 11 also adds a new night mode which is automatically enabled for low light environments. The front camera also gets bumped to 12MP along with 4K 60fps video capture and Slow Mo videos on the front camera. </p> <p>There are also new portrait studio lighting effects which look impressive. </p> <p>The display on the Apple iPhone 11 is a 6.1 inch Liquid Retina display also similar to the iPhone XR. But the innards get an upgrade with a new Apple A13 Bionic chip.</p> <p>The Apple iPhone 11 retains the iP68 water resistance along with an aluminum body. </p> <p>iPhone 11 also improves the battery, with Apple claiming an additional 1 hour of battery life. </p> <p>The Apple iPhone 11 starts at US$ 699. In India the iPhone 11 will be available in 64GB, 128GB and 256GB models in purple, green, yellow, black, white and PRODUCT(RED) starting at INR 64,900. </p>

A primary 12 MP camera with an f/1.8 aperture, 26mm lens and OIS. The second camera is a telephoto 12 MP sensor with a 52mm lens with an f/2.0 aperture. The third is an ultra wide camera also a 12MP sensor with a 13 mm lens and an f/2.4 aperture. </p> <p></p> <p>A new feature that will be enabled with a software update is called Deep Fusion that takes 9 pictures and fuses the pixels from the images to get really sharp images. </p> <p></p> <p>The video is now 4k 60fps with extended dynamic rage across all three camera sensors. The video capture now offers low light performance, and deep blacks across the video spectrum. </p> <p></p> <p>The cameras and the new A13 Bionic chip are versatile enough to capture multiple video streams together. Which means you can simultaneously record a standard video and a zoomed in video. This will also work on the front camera which is also a 12 MP sensor with 4k 60fps recording capabilities. This will be a great feature for video makers to exploit. </p> <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVEemOmHw9Y</p> <p> </p> <p>The new iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max will start at US$ 999 and US$ 1099 respectively. </p> <p>The Apple iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max will be available in 64GB, 256GB and 512GB models in midnight green, space gray, silver and gold starting at INR 99,900  and INR 109,900</p> <p> </p>
