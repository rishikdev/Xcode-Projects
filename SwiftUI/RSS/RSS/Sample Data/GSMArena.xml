                There are already reports on Reddit from people who have received the update notification. It's a 1GB download and once you've installed it you'll be on software version 67.2.A.2.41.
                
                
                
                The update brings Private Space with it. This lets you keep apps in a separate space in the app drawer, behind a lock.
                
                Additionally, there's a color contrast setting for the Home screen, a new way to change the clock displayed on the lock screen,...]]>&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This has now been portrayed in the first leaked renders.
                
                
                
                The Galaxy S25 Slim allegedly measures 159 x 76 x 6.4 mm. That makes it just about the size of the Galaxy S24+ (and, we assume, the S25+ as well), except, obviously, it's much thinner. For what it's worth the Galaxy S24+ is 7.7 mm thick.
                
                
                
                The Galaxy S25 Slim is apparently 8.3 mm thick at the camera bump, which is just 0.1 mm more than what the Galaxy S25 Ultra is expected to be at...]]>&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But the Korean company has tested the Galaxy S25+ with an Exynos chipset in the past - not once, but twice in fact. So it looks like the decision to be all-in with the Snapdragon 8 Elite wasn't taken from the get-go. Presumably, the company wanted to use its own SoC but decided against it when yield issues kept popping up.
                
                The good news is that today the global Galaxy S25+, identified by the model number SM-S936B, has taken to Geekbench again, and this...]]>&lt;/p&gt;</description>

So when you want to make the slimmest phone possible, something's got to give. Or, in the case of Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 Air, multiple somethings. The rumored single rear camera is one compromise made in the name of slimness, and today another one has been revealed: battery capacity.
                
                But the iPhone isn't alone in this, the Galaxy S25 Slim may pack more cameras but it won't be a battery life king either, that's for sure. According to Digital Chat Station on Weibo, both of these devices will have batteries between 3,000 mAh and...]]>&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Pro model was initially rumored to come with a 7,500 mAh battery, but then another rumor toned this down talking about "low 7,000s".
                
                Today another rumor on the matter reiterates what the first one said and states that the 7,500 mAh battery capacity has been "confirmed" through prototype testing. Of course, this is far from an official confirmation, so do keep that in mind.

The device was spotted in hands-on photos, where the model number was seen, allowing us to find the device on TENAA.
                
                The images and the listing revealed a 6,500 mAh battery (6,330 mAh minimal rate, split into two cells) and a 6.7” AMOLED panel.

                This is the third Oppo A5 we have encountered, after the one launched in 2018, followed by another one from 2020. The Oppo A series is incredibly popular at home, covering a large price spectrum from ultra-cheap entry-level phones to...]]>&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Magic7 Pro will get five years of OS updates and five years of security updates.
                
                
                
                This means that the Magic7 Pro will be running the latest version of Android and security patches until January 2030. The new update policy adds an additional year of OS updates compared to last year’s Magic6 Pro.

Q4 2024 was the sixth consecutive quarter of growing shipments – 331.7 million smartphones were shipped in the three-month period, up 2.4% compared to the same period a year prior.
                
                Apple and Samsung remained the market leaders, though both saw a decline in shipments compared to the final quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, Xiaomi secured its third position and started closing the gap to Samsung.

                The flagship Magic7 Pro was announced for China back in late October, while the Magic7 Lite went global a few weeks ago.
                
                
                
                Honor Magic7 Pro
                
                Let's start with the Magic7 Pro. It packs the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, 12 GB of RAM, and a 5,270mAh battery with 100W wired and wireless charging. That's a difference with the Chinese model, which sports a 5,850mAh power pack. The global Magic7 Pro also marks a decrease compared to its predecessor, which had 5,600mAh battery.

Beijing prefers the US operations of the controversial app remain in the hands of ByteDance, but with the looming ban scheduled for January 19, officials are frantically looking for a resolution.
                
                
                
                Sources who spoke with Bloomberg revealed Chinese officials are debating contingency plans for TikTok as part of an expansive discussion on how to work with President-elect Donald Trump.

This foldable features an enhanced cover screen, waterproof capabilities, and a new Mediatek chipset. The ZTE brand announced the Flip 2 in Japan and plans to begin sales next week.
                
                
                
                The nubia Flip 2 keeps a foldable 6.9" AMOLED on the inside, with the panel having Full HD+ resolution and a punch hole for a 32 MP camera. There isn't a fingerprint scanner under the display as it is on the side, doubling as a power key.

                The source claims that the Realme P3 Pro will sport model code RMX5032 and have 12GB RAM and 256GB of storage onboard. However, there could be more memory configurations that are yet to be confirmed.

Known so far only by its model number, RMX5020, the device has been certified for sale by the FCC, a move which signifies a global launch.
                
                The RMX5020 has dual-band Wi-Fi, NFC, nine 4G bands, and a 5,180 mAh battery with support for 45W wired charging. Different certifications reveal it boasts a 6.67-inch screen (just like the 14x, we might add), 6GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage. It will launch running Realme UI 6.0.

This time around we have a couple of shots showing the Galaxy S25 or the S25+ (they look exactly the same, the only difference is the size) on one hand, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra on the other.
                
                There's an interesting detail in this first image, namely that the outer part of the camera 'rings' matches the color of the phone's back, at least in this rather dark blue hue.
                
                
                
                As you can see, the frame is flat, the screen is flat, and the bezels are insanely thin (and thinner than last year). Moving on to the Ultra, the color matching of the camera...]]>&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                Today's chapter is all about Sketch to Image, the AI feature that launched last year. With the Galaxy S25 series (and presumably the One UI 7 update for older flagship models), this will get even better.
                
                
                
                Sketch to Image will be integrated into Drawing Assist and will be able to use more than one input. So you can still sketch, either with the S Pen or your finger, but you can also describe the...]]>&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                Next up, you can turn a selfie into a sticker. This is pretty self-explanatory. You just tap Create sticker and you'll get the camera option to take a selfie on the spot and create your sticker. This is rolling out to Android now and will be available on iOS "soon".

A report from Counterpoint Research last year indicated that the Galaxy S24 Ultra made up 52% of total sales, the small S24 was at 27% while the Galaxy S24+ only accounted for 21% of sales.
                
                And that was with solid upgrades compared to the S23+: a new LTPO display with QHD+ resolution, 12GB of RAM and a slightly larger battery. Okay, not stunning upgrades, but it’s more than the S24 got.
