# About RYTD (Return YouTube Dislike)
I developed this application in response to the high demand for a Safari-specific extension to view YouTube dislike counts.
While similar tools exist for other browsers, as a dedicated Safari user, I often felt left out. 
So, I took matters into my own hands and built this extension for Safari users like you!

Rather than building the back-end from scratch, I leveraged the [Return YouTube Dislike](https://returnyoutubedislike.com) API, 
which is not only free but also widely trusted and used by other popular extensions.

This application offers full support for both ***light*** and ***dark*** modes, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices, 
including iPhones, iPads, and Macs.
