# About My Notes

I have developed this application because I wanted to learn iOS development. While doing so, I learned about the ***MVVM Architecture*** in which the **UI component (view)** of the application is completely isolated from the **logic** of the application. I also learned how to save user data locally using ***Core Data***.

There are some modifiers that I have used in this application which are only supported in iOS versions 15 and above. Therefore, this application is only compatible with devices that run ***iOS 15 or later***. One such modifier is the <code>.searchable</code> modifier which makes it quite easy to implement the search functionality.

I have also implemented the slide to edit feature along with the ***Edit*** button in the top left, which, currently, only supports **deleting** a note. I am planning to add more functionalities, such as the ability to **lock** a note, in future in this edit menu.

This applications also supports both ***light*** as well as ***dark*** mode across all devices natively. Currently I have limited the compatibility to just the iPhones (iOS 15 and later) as I do not have an iPad to test this application on. However, support for iPads can be enabled without changing much of the program.
